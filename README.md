 # Problems
 if from any reason, the tool seems not responding, or showing errors, try to see if you filled the correct URL. Sometimes it happens, and could fix the issue you have. for exapmle : "http://", https://, slash(/) at the end of the URL. it might and could be the problem you have when enumerate/scan for directories.
